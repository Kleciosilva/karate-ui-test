# About

This repository contains automated tests using **Karate Test Automation**: [Karate GitHub](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate).

The tests include scenarios for validating different pages and actions on the **NASA Hubble Mission** website and image download functionality.

## Features

### 1. **Validate Hubble Mission Page**
This test validates the **Hubble Mission Page** by checking that the text "Overview" exists in the second navigation item of the page.

**Scenario:**
- Opens the **Hubble Mission Page**.
- Waits for the second item in the navigation menu.
- Verifies that the text **"Overview"** is present.

### 2. **Open and Validate Image Download**
This test simulates the user opening the **NASA Hubble gallery**, clicking on the first image, and validating that the image can be downloaded.

**Scenario:**
- Opens the **Hubble Space Shuttle Missions Gallery**.
- Clicks on the first image in the gallery.
- Verifies that the new page's URL contains `https://science.nasa.gov/image-detail/`.
- Clicks the download button and validates that the image is successfully downloaded.

### 3. **Download Image**
This feature simulates downloading an image from the gallery.

**Scenario:**
- Opens the **Hubble Space Shuttle Missions Gallery**.
- Clicks on the first image to open the detailed view.
- Verifies the URL for image details.

## Running UI Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
mvnw clean test -Dtest=UiTestRunner
```

This will trigger the Karate tests for UI interactions and file download validation.

## Reports

After running the tests, you can view the reports at:

```bash
file:///D:/apps/tests/karate-frontend-tests/target/karate-reports/karate-summary.html
```

The reports provide detailed information about each test execution, including status, screenshots (if enabled), and more.

## **Test Configuration and Setup**

### **Headless Browser Mode:**
By default, the tests run in **headless** mode, which means no browser window will appear during the tests. This is configured in the `karate-config.js` file, where you can customize the WebDriver preferences.

### **File Download Validation:**
To check if a file was downloaded correctly, the tests are configured to monitor the download directory. The download process is verified based on the downloaded fileâ€™s URL and content type.
